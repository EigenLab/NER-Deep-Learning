Using BiLSTM-CRF model for Chinese NER

## Char + Word Segment
This model is almost the same as [ChineseNER](https://github.com/zjy-ucas/ChineseNER), I implement it to learn the CRF model in tensorflow. I borrowed a lot data processing and evaluation code from [ChineseNER](https://github.com/zjy-ucas/ChineseNER), thanks to the author for sharing the code and the training data.
